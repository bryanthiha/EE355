The C program takes in three input arguments to calculate the sum of two numbers squared plus an error value which is generated randomly.
The python progam genrates three random values and calls the C program to input those values while calculating an error free result as well. Then we take the absolute value of the difference and write those values into a file.

Overall, I did not have any issues with this lab, it was mostly trying to review C syntax. The only issue I ran into was trying to get the syntax correct for the check_output function to link the python and c program. After a few trial and errors, I was able to solve this issue.
