Q10) First scenario:
     Program prints out all elements in array greater than 2 and their 
     indices.
      5
      0
      6
      2
      13
      3

   When print statement is moved out of if statement, it still prints
   elements greater than 2, but now prints every index of array.

      Second Scenario:
      Program checks if user input x is greater than 5. If so, adds 6 
      then checks if less than 15. If not, subtracts 5, then prints x.
      If so, prints x, then checks if greater than 13. If so,
      prints arrived. If user inputs 6, this is output:
      12
      
      By changing the else statement connected to the middle if statement 
      that checks if less than 15, to the inner most nested if statement,
      if user inputs 6, this is what we get:
      12
      7
